# JPG Photos of Famous People

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/bibliography/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

All photos are taken from public Internet resources.

If you want your photo to disappear from this repository,
just [email me](mailto:yegor256@gmail.com).

If you want to use these photos too, just add this repo
as a Git [submodule][submodule] to your repo:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/yegor256/faces
```

I'm using them in almost all my lecture notes, including:

* [Software Quality Metrics (SQM)](https://github.com/yegor256/sqm)
* [Pain of OOP](https://github.com/yegor256/sqm)
* [Software System Design](https://github.com/yegor256/ssd16)
